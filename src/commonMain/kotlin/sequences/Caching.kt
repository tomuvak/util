/**
 * Returns a sequence which yields the exact same elements as the receiver sequence [this] and is iterable multiple
 * times â€“ even if the original sequence is not. The original sequence is guaranteed not to be iterated over more than
 * once, and, at any point during the first (and only) iteration, not to be iterated over further than is necessary.
 *
 * The behavior of the returned sequence in case iterating the original sequence throws an error at any point is
 * undefined.
 *
 * The elements of the original sequence are accessible as long as the returned sequence (or an iterator thereof) is
 * alive. To allow them to be garbage-collected, make sure not to keep references to the returned sequence once it's no
 * longer needed.
 *
 * This operation is _intermediate_ and _stateful_.
